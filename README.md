# KML Translator
This Python script translates text within a KML (Keyhole Markup Language) file using the Google Translator API. It helps you to localize or change the language of text content in your KML files.


## Prerequisites
Before using this script, you need to install the required Python libraries. You can install them using pip:

- pip install deep-translator


## Usage
To use the script, follow these steps:
- Place your KML file that you want to translate in the same directory as this script, or provide the full path to the input KML file in the input_kml_file variable.
- Specify the output file path in the output_kml_file variable. This is where the translated KML content will be saved.
- Run the script using Python: (python translate_kml.py The script will automatically translate the text within the KML file and create an output file with the translated content.)

## Customization
You can customize the source and target languages for translation by modifying the source and target parameters in the translator initialization:
translator = GoogleTranslator(source='auto', target='en')
Make sure to replace 'auto' and 'en' with the desired source and target language codes.

## Error Handling
If any errors occur during translation, the script will print an error message to the console. You can modify the error handling logic in the script to suit your needs.
